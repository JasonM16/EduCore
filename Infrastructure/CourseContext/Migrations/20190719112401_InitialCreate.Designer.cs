We will examine the role of gender systems at different times and places in Islamic history through primary sources. Some themes of the course may be 1) the ways in which discourses of gender were constructed in ways usually disadvantageous to women. Though careful attention must be paid to important differences in time and place; 2) The relationship of gender systems to other hierarchical social structures such as class, ethnicity and age; 3) women and mens’ roles in preserving and constructing the gender systems of their society; and 4) the ways in which women and men were able to exercise agency in overcoming or transcending limitations of the dominant discourses on gender.",

The course fosters professional development wherein personal and professional skills are promoted in the interest of competent professional practice. Students will develop competence as an entry level professional in generalist social work practice within the four contexts of practice: organization, community, social work skills and professional context. Supported by Field Learning Specialists with extensive practice experience and professional social workers, students will develop substantive understanding of social work knowledge, values and skills and demonstrate an understanding of and commitment to the principles which underlie professional social work practice.This course operates as a practicum three days a week in the Fall semester.
